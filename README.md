# PPE_KIT_AND_MASK_DETECTION
Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision, with applications ranging from surveillance to autonomous driving. 

One of the most widely used deep learning-based object detection models is YOLO (You Only Look Once), which has undergone several improvements over the years. In this project, we present an object detection model based on the latest version of YOLO, called YOLOv8, for detecting personal protective equipment (PPE) kits and masks.

The detection of PPE kits and masks is critical for ensuring the safety of frontline workers and the general public. 

Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the YOLOv8 model for detecting PPE kits and masks in real-worldÂ scenarios.
